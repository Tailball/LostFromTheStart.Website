                    <p>
                        By utilising melodic guitar parts and catchy, yet thoughtful lyrics, the band reaches out to everyone trying to find their way. 
                        A fair warning though, the songs might get stuck in your head for days.
                        <br/>
                        Lost From The Start found inspiration in bands they listened to back in the days, while still managing to keep a fresh and unique sound.
